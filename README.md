## 💡 Why Use GAMstack?

### ✊ Manifest

A few principles we believe in — for both creators and developers:

- ✅ **As simple as possible** — design, structure, workflow. Less is more.
- 💽 **You control your files** — keep them on your own drive, your repo, your rules.
- 🖥️ **Every device, every OS** — works on Mac, Windows, Linux, even mobile.
- 🧠 **Markdown-first mindset** — plain text, clear thinking.
- 💨 **Instant publish** — write → push → live.
- 🗃️ **Versioned, trackable, transparent** — powered by Git.
- 🕊️ **Minimal setup, maximal freedom.**

### 💡 Why Use GAMstack? - ⛵ For Creators

- ✍️ Write your content in **Markdown**, like a normal doc or note.
- 💡 No distractions – no logins, no popups, no notifications.
- 🧘‍♀️ Zen flow – write once, publish instantly.
- 🌐 Your content becomes a **real website** people can visit.
- 🧳 Ideal if you’ve bounced between **Notion, Obsidian, Ulysses, Apple Notes**, etc.

### 💡 Why Use GAMstack? - 💻 For Developers

- ⚙️ Automate content builds using **GitHub Actions**.
- 🔁 Use **CI/CD** for changelogs, release notes, documentation.
- 🧠 Follow **GitOps principles** – Git is your single source of truth.
- 🧩 Configure structure via **YAML files** – infrastructure as content.
- 💬 Integrate into existing Git workflows – no extra hosting required.
- 🧰 Great for **internal docs, team microsites, project landing pages**.
- 🛰️ Zero-runtime, serverless by default – no Node, no Docker, no servers.

#### Extra: 🕰️ Old Software Stacks Roast (and why GAMstack is better)

GAMstack is the next step after these old stacks:

- **JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup)** — because JavaScript is bloated and Markdown was doing just fine.
- **MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless)** — because microservices are just meetings in disguise.
- **LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python)** — because it's not 2002 and we're done FTPing PHP files at midnight.
- **LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP)** — because Nginx is still just Apache in hard mode.
- **WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)** — because deploying to Windows is like watering your plants with Coca-Cola.
- **XAMPP (Cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl)** — because nothing says "developer experience" like running a local Perl server in 2025.
- **MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js)** — because Angular made you question your career.
- **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** — because React turned your blog into a distributed system.
- **MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue, Node.js)** — because Vue is cute but you still needed Node, Babel, and 19 plugins.
- **PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js)** — because PostgreSQL is great, but now your front-end has 300 dependencies to render a button.
- **Django Stack (Python, Django, PostgreSQL)** — because the ORM is magic... until it isn't, and therapy all start with “T.”
- **Firebase Stack (Firestore, Functions, Auth, Hosting)** — because Google wants your soul and your billing info.
- **SST (Serverless Stack) (CDK, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)** — because debugging cold starts at 3AM builds character.
- **AWS CDK Stack (AWS Cloud Development Kit + TypeScript)** — because writing TypeScript to generate YAML that generates JSON to deploy infra is totally sane.
- **Kubernetes-native (Helm, Kustomize, ArgoCD, YAML)** — because containers in containers in YAML in clusters is totally not overcomplicated.
- **RAPID Stack (React, API-first, Platform Independent, DevOps-ready)** — because fast acronyms make fast apps. Maybe not overcomplicated.
- **Vite Stack** — because Webpack broke your spirit in 2021.
- **Docs-as-Code** — because your documentation deserves more care than your production code.
- **Zettelkasten Stack** — because you treat your second brain better than your first.

### 📌 Setup Using the GitHub Website

#### Step 1: Copy the GAMstack Repository

1. Go to the [GAMstack Repository](https://github.com/roktiw/gamstack/).
2. Click **Fork** in the top right corner.
3. Click **Create fork**.

#### Step 2: Open the `/input/` Folder and Write Your Content

- This is where you put your website files.
- Write your files in Markdown format (`.md`).
- If you need help with Markdown, see [this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

1. Write your first note or edit an existing `.md` file.
2. Save the file.

Example:
```markdown
# Hello World

This is my first post using GAMstack.
```

#### Step 3: Save and Upload Your Changes

2. Click **Commit changes** to save.

- The `.github/workflow/gamstack.yml` script will turn `.md` files in `/input/` into `.html` files in `/output/`.
- It will also update the `index.html` file for your website.

#### Step 4: Open the `/output/` Folder and Check the Build

1. Check if GitHub Actions successfully built your site:
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Look for the latest workflow run. It should show a green checkmark if it succeeded.
   - If it failed, click on the workflow run to see the logs and troubleshoot the issue.

2. Alternatively, you can preview the generated files locally in VS Code:
   - Open the `/output/` folder in your repository.
   - Use a Markdown preview extension or a local server to view the generated `.html` files.

#### Step 5: See Your Website Online

1. Edit any file in `/input/` and save/commit.
2. After a few minutes, your site will be live at `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/`.
