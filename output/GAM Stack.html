<h1>GAM Stack: GitHub Actions + Markdown</h1>
<h2>What is GAM Stack?</h2>
<p>GAM Stack is a minimalistic static site generation framework I created. It converts Markdown files to HTML using <strong>only GitHub Actions</strong>, without any local build tools or external dependencies.</p>
<p>This means there is no Node.js, Ruby, Python, or any static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo. All logic is executed inside GitHub Actions workflows, and the result is published directly to GitHub Pages.</p>
<h2>Why I Built It</h2>
<p>I was experimenting with lightweight alternatives to traditional SSGs. I wanted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid maintaining build environments</li>
<li>Leverage GitHub Actions as a universal CI/CD platform</li>
<li>Keep everything in plain Markdown and simple shell scripts</li>
<li>Publish sites instantly via GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>After researching various JAMstack approaches, I noticed that no existing CMS or SSG truly used GitHub Actions alone as the build engine. So I decided to create one myself.</p>
<h2>Who Is It For?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developers who want extreme minimalism</li>
<li>People who write in Markdown and want automatic HTML conversion</li>
<li>DevOps engineers looking for fully Git-based publishing</li>
<li>Anyone curious about what's possible with GitHub Actions alone</li>
</ul>
