<h1>Problem with Branches and PAT in GitHub Actions</h1>
<p>It seems that the issue with branches and requiring a PAT (Personal Access Token) was due to the workflow configuration, which attempted to push changes to the remote repository. In your case, if the workflow works correctly without a PAT, it means that the <code>github-actions[bot]</code> has sufficient permissions to push changes to the main branch.</p>
<p>If you are not creating additional branches and everything works on the main branch, there is no need to use a PAT. The workflow has been correctly configured to operate within the default permissions of GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š</p>
