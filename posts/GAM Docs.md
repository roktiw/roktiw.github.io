## How the GAM Stack Works in This Project

In this project, the GAM Stack operates as follows:

**Backend**:
   - This project does not include a traditional backend (e.g., Node.js server). It appears to be a fully static site, meaning all content is served directly as static files.

**DevOps**:
   - GitHub Actions is used to automate updates to the `index.html` file. The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/update-index.yml` triggers a script (`update-index.js`) that scans the `posts/` directory for new Markdown files and appends them as links to the main `index.html` file.
   - The project is likely hosted on GitHub Pages, making it accessible as a static website.

**Content and Structure**:
   - The `posts/` folder contains Markdown files (`.md`) that serve as content for the site, such as documentation or blog posts. These files are dynamically linked in the main `index.html`.

In summary, this project is a static website with automated content updates powered by GitHub Actions. It organizes content into separate projects and posts, making it modular and easy to maintain.
