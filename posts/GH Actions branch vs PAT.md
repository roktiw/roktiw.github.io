# Problem with Branches and PAT in GitHub Actions

It seems that the issue with branches and requiring a PAT (Personal Access Token) was due to the workflow configuration, which attempted to push changes to the remote repository. In your case, if the workflow works correctly without a PAT, it means that the `github-actions[bot]` has sufficient permissions to push changes to the main branch.

If you are not creating additional branches and everything works on the main branch, there is no need to use a PAT. The workflow has been correctly configured to operate within the default permissions of GitHub Actions.

If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
